# Plotly-Challenge
Plotly hw

Here is my homework submission for the plotly hw. 

was running out of time but got it uploaded to pages!

I found this difficult, I had a tough go with matPlot so Im learning these plot-type programs get me mixed up, but I still enjoy the challenge.

* I first went and dynamically set up the drop down menu with all the names

* Then I set up the default charts that would load with the page

* Then re-read the json file to start coding

* Set pieces of the data into variables and arrays to be called/used later

* I got the panel area for demographics set up next to change with your selection

* Went through and got all the necessary sliced/sorted/reversed data for the charts

* I redefined the bubble chart within the function with the json file so it would just update with the function much like the bar chart, although I called the bar chart to up through the update plotly. I did it in two different ways to show flexibility in coding.

*  I set the panel to reset between options

* called functions to update the bar chart info

* Lastly called the default function so the defualted plots would show upon page load.

I set up a different repo for the deployment so it was less cluttered and easier to load for that. The other work is in the main repo, I will link both.
